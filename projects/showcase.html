                    Showcase v4 is the fourth iteration of my showcase site, featuring many improvements, both ones visible to you and ones behind the scenes, allowing me to better maintain this site, while featuring more information about each project that is being showcased.
                    Showcase v4 has had refactors for much of the codebase that was ported from v3, new additions not seen before in v3, as well as a complete visual overhaul.

                            Design was thought up by:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Ariel / CalicoCatio</li>

                            </ul>
                            I came up with the inital concept of a platformer in the dark, with stationary lamps, and Jacob added by suggesting that we use a flashlight instead.
                            This was a great idea, as the player would be forced to check their surroundings, as you can't check to see if an enemy is coming up behind you unless you physically move the mouse.

                            Code was written by:
                            <ul>

                            </ul>
                            The player controller, as well as the custom physics that comes along with it, enemy AI (and physics) as well as the flaslight were all products of Jacob's handywork.
                            I handled the more boring tasks like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine" target="_blank">FSM</a> and the UI.
                            I also made the level loader and high level frameworks for managing the UI and the game (while in the gameplay mode of the FSM).
                            George refactored my level loader to work with square assets, as the loader was orignally made with rectangular ones in mind, and also implemented all of his artwork.

                                <li>Internally, Blinded by the Dark is called Working-Title, as we didn't come up with the name until after starting development.</li>
                                <li>Blinded by the Dark's codebase is a clash of two different programing styles, since we had no time for pre-production; but VS 2022 still gave v0.3 a maintainability score of 81/100.</li>
                                <li>The flashlight is actually just a really large texture that covers most of the screenâ€”no fancy lighting required!</li>
                                <li>Since the level loader was changed from rectangles to squares, the enemies no longer stop themselves from walking off the edge.</li>
                                <li>Blinded by the Dark features just four levels, but on my first try it still took me over 20 minutes to beat.</li>
